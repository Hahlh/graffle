# Why Graffle?

Graffle is a GraphQL client for JavaScript that works in all major run-times (browsers, Node, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, ...). It's goal is to be a fantastic general purpose way to execute [GraphQL documents](https://todo) in scripts or backend logic. It may work work well for your frontend logic too but Graffle does not specialize there unlike other tools such as [RelayJS](https://relay.dev) and [Urql](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/urql/docs/).

Initially Graffle is an easy way to send GraphQL requests over HTTP or in-memory. Extensions bring additional power like [OTEL](https://todo) or [file upload](https://todo) support. You work with GraphQL's native document syntax. This description so far paints Graffle as a more flexible and stable version of its previous version known as `graphql-request`. However, its value proposition doesn't end there. You can opt into using its generated client bringing benefits like:
