The `document` method is used to create whole GraphQL documents.

There are other more targeted ways of sending GraphQL requests when you don't need to author the entire document.

- If you only need to work with a _single operation type_ then use [`$batch`](./batch.md).
- If you only need to work with a _single root field_ then use [root field methods](./root-fields.md).
